== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== User Interface

_The default interface used for Solid project is written in JavaScript and AngularJS with a minimal Bootstrap template._

=== JavaScript and CSS optimization

_In progress_

=== Transaction Processing

=== Session Handling

=== Security

=== Safety

_No part of the system has life endangering aspect._

=== Communications and Integration

_In progress_

=== Plausibility and Validity Checks

=== Exception/Error Handling

_Errors handling to inconsistent data (in regard to the data models constraint) as well as failures to validation are mapped to HTTP errors. Those errors are handled by the frontends controller code. Technical errors (hardware, database etc.) are not handled and may lead to application failure or lost data._

=== Logging, Tracing

_In progress_

=== Configurability

_In progress_

=== Internationalization

_Englis is the only supported language at the moment and there are no plans for creating a new one._

=== Migration

_In progress_

=== Testability
