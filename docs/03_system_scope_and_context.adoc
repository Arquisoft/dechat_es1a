|*Participant*|*Action*
| User 1 | Sends message to the app.
| SOLID Pod User 1 | Stores the message sent, so only User 1 can read it.

Our application will be deployed using https://www.docker.com/why-docker[Docker] and https://www.heroku.com/[Heroku]. The application itself can be seen as two main artifacts: On one hand, the login using POD identifiers. On the other hand, the shared messages between the members of the chat.
