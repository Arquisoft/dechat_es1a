== 2.1-Technical Constraints


|=== 

|  | *Constraint* | *Background and /or motivation*

| TC1 | Implementation in JavaScript/TypeScript | Because the application will be web-based, the best option is to use JavaScript.

| TC2 | Angular as front end framework | Most SOLID-based applications use this framework, so it is a sensible bet to use it as well.

| TC3 | Docker and Heroku for application deployment | Due to the experience of several team members these deployment tools have been chosen.

| TC4 | Descentralized architecture | The application is based on SOLID, a project for the decentralization of applications, so the application will have a decentralized architecture.
