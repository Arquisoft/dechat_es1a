=== Persistency

As SOLID is decentralized, there is not going to be a database where everyone can check messages sent and received. Instead, we'll be creating folders for each conversation and only member of the conversation will have access to those folders, where all the relevant data is going to be stored. For this purpose we are going to use the .ttl format


=== User Interface

The default interface used for Solid project is written in JavaScript and AngularJS with a minimal Bootstrap template.

=== Transaction Processing

The transactions realized across the application are asynchronous

=== Session Handling

Session is handled by Solid Authentication Client, so it keeps you logged in and you can navigate through your pod, friends lists or chats.

=== Security

The security is provided by the Solid Authentication Client and the POD, that manages the session.

=== Safety

No part of the system has life endangering aspect.

=== Exception/Error Handling

Errors handling to inconsistent data (in regard to the data models constraint) as well as failures to validation are mapped to HTTP errors. Those errors are handled by the frontends controller code. Technical errors (hardware, database etc.) are not handled and may lead to application failure or lost data.

=== Testability

For the testability we used JEST modules to test the JavaScript code and Angular side.
