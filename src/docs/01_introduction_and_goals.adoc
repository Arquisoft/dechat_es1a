== Introduction and Goals

The main purpose of this project is to create a decentralized chat, helping people communicate while preserving their privacy.

=== Requirements Overview

.What is dechat_es1a?
The main purpose of this app is to let people communicate with each other while storing their own data, letting them decide who shall view their information rather than storing it in a traditional centralized server, where you are not completely sure who has access to it.

.Main features/requirements
App requirements can be found https://labra.solid.community/public/SoftwareArchitecture/EnunciadoPractica/#requirements[here].

These requirements revolve around a decentralized app, following the fundamentals of https://github.com/solid/solid#about-solid[SOLID].

=== Quality Goals
