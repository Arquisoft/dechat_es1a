.What is dechat_es1a?
The main purpose of our app is to let people communicate with each other while storing their own data, letting them decide who shall view their information rather than storing it in a traditional centralized server, where you are not completely sure who has access to it.

.Main features/requirements
App requirements are written down in the  https://labra.solid.community/public/SoftwareArchitecture/EnunciadoPractica/#requirements[requirements document].

This requirements revolve around a decentralized app, which is all https://github.com/solid/solid#about-solid[SOLID is about]. Other than that, the app has to be a classic chat where you can talk to friends (individually or in groups), receive notifications and share multimedia.
