Level 4::

For the app to be able to send messages in a proper way, models, services and components are needed. In this app the
models used where those relating to the main functionality of the app (profile, session, message, friends and SOLID provider).

The main services used are RDF for storing the messages in the POD, Authentication and AuthGuard for login and registration purposes
and chat service, where all the code for interacting with the previous libraries is written.

A component for each different view of the application is needed.
