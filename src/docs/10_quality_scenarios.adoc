|[.SpellE]#Nr#. |[.SpellE]#Quality# |[.SpellE]#Scenario#

|1 |[.SpellE]#Usability# |Each section of the technical documentation
must be understood by itself without the need to read the rest of the
documentation. Any content should be found immediately in the
documentation

|2 |[.SpellE]#Responsiveness# |Once completed, the application must pass
the Google Responsiveness Test
(https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)

|3 |[.SpellE]#Securability# |A third party will not be allowed to access
the data transmitted between two users in a chat session. When chatting, 
users can get access to his data and to his friend's data, 
but not to other one's data.

|4 |[.SpellE]#Simplicity# |A non-technical user who has never used the
application should be able to open a chat session with another user in
less than 3 minutes.

|5 |[.SpellE]#Efficiency# |When sending a message through the chat, it
will be received by the recipient in a reasonable time (less than 3s).

|6 |[.SpellE]#Modifiability# |The application should have a 
correct design so that the modifications that must be made during the 
project can be addressed by the team in less than a week of work.#


|7 |[.SpellE]#Robustness# |The system is compiled and passes 
all the tests without errors. Code coverage is analized by means of Codecov (https://codecov.io/),
and coverage percent should be at least 60%.#


|8 |[.SpellE]#Maintainability# |The application must be divided into different modules. All public
methods in the application must be well documented with JSDoc. Code quality 
is analized by means of Codacy (https://www.codacy.com/) and must be at least "b" level #


|9 |[.SpellE]#Testability# |[.SpellE]#The project must implement continuous integration test using Travis CI.#
